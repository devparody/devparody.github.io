00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:09.760
User goes "goof", Boss goes "now"

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:13.670
Twitter goes "tweet", And followers "bleet"

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:17.390
Error goes "spew", Bug goes "broke"

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:21.350
And the manager goes "root"

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:24.840
Hole say "hack" And git go "hub"

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:29.030
And support goes "ow ow ow"

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.320
But there's one sound

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.180
That no one knows

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:37.340

Caffiene is nice, And back door holes

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:17.420
Tired hands, Empty mug

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.140
Suddenly you're coding bugs

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:24.840
CI is green, So beautiful

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:28.940
Like an angel in disguise

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:32.310
But if you go, On a git branch course

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:36.350
How will you deal with that

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:38.920
So-o-o-o-ource? So-o-o-o-ource? So-o-o-o-ource?

The secret of the dev, technical mystery

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:33.370
Somewhere deep in the code

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:37.050
I know you're hacking

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:40.700
